It is a simple and fast way to perform exploratory data analysis of a Pandas Dataframe.  The pandas`df.describe()`and  `df.info()functions` are normally used as a first step in the EDA process. However, it only gives a very basic overview of the data and doesn’t help much in the case of large data sets. The Pandas Profiling function, on the other hand, extends the pandas DataFrame  with`df.profile_report()`  for quick data analysis. It displays a lot of information with a single line of code and that too in an interactive HTML report.\n",
